# The VibeTracker "Sniper" Strategy (For Beginners) 🛡️💰

**Goal**: Profit preservation. It is better to miss a 100x than to lose your principal.
**Rule #1**: Only trade what you can afford to lose (e.g., $50-100 total portfolio).
**Rule #2**: Never fall in love with a coin. It is a ticker, not a friend.

## 🛑 Step 1: Filtering (The "No" Phase)
Use VibeTracker to filter out 90% of the garbage.

1.  **Set Sort to "🛡️ Safest (High Vibe)"**:
    *   As a newbie, **ignore everything else**.
    *   Do not touch "Newest" or "Riskiest" until you have doubled your portfolio twice.
2.  **Check the Badge**:
    *   Only look at ✅ **Safe-ish** or ⚠️ **Risky** (Green/Yellow).
    *   **NEVER** buy a 💀 **Degen Play** (Red).
3.  **Liquidity Check**:
    *   Ideally > **$50k Liquidity**.
    *   Ideally > **$50k Volume (1h)**.
    *   If liquidity is under $10k, it's too easy for one person to crash the price.

## 🔍 Step 2: The Deep Scan (The "Wait" Phase)
You found a coin with a Green Badge and good stats. **DO NOT BUY YET.**

1.  Click the **Blue Shield** (RugCheck).
2.  **The Dealbreakers (Instant Pass)**:
    *   🚩 **Mint Authority**: Enabled.
    *   🚩 **LP Locked**: Unlocked or < 90%.
    *   🚩 **Top Holders**: Top 1 wallet > 20%.
3.  **Insider Check**:
    *   If "Insider Analysis" shows > 10%, be very careful. This is the "Cabal" risk.

## 🔫 Step 3: The Entry (The "Snipe" Phase)
Everything looks good.
1.  **Position Size**: Put in **5-10% of your portfolio** max. (e.g., $10 on a $100 portfolio).
2.  **Add to Vault**: Immediately bookmark it in VibeTracker.

## 💰 Step 4: The Exit (The "Profit" Phase)
This is where newbies fail. They hold for "generational wealth." You are here for "lunch money" first.

1.  **Use the Crystal Ball**:
    *   Check your projected 24h gain. Is it realistic?
2.  **Use the Profit Calculator**:
    *   **The "Doubler" Rule**: If the calculator shows **+100% (2x)**, sell **50%** of your coins.
        *   Now your initial $10 is back in your pocket.
        *   The remaining coins are "Moon Bags" (risk-free).
3.  **The Stop-Loss**:
    *   If your Vault shows **-20%**, **SELL**.
    *   Do not "hope it comes back." Take the $2 loss and move on.
